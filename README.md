### What I learned

I actually had a lot of trouble trying to position both svg circles on the background. I ended up using this solution:

```css
.background {
	background-image: url('images/bg-pattern-top.svg'),
		url('images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-size: contain;
	background-position: top -200px left -200px, bottom -200px right -200px;
}
```

The tricky part I found was with the background-position property. Instead of just setting "top left" and "bottom right", I had to specify offset values on top of that to match the design given.
